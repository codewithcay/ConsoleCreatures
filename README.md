# ConsoleCreatures
C# can be used to make nearly anything – even creatures! Using the Console.WriteLine() command, you can print text to the console and make something like this:

 .-.
(o o)
| O |
|   |
'~~~'


Each part of the creature is a line of text, using symbols like parentheses () and tildes ~. Spooky, right? These types of drawings are sometimes called ASCII art, and you can find them all across the internet.

The C# program is already set up for you in the text editor. For now, you can ignore everything except the line with Console.WriteLine();. You’ll be copying and editing this command throughout the project.

Make sure to use double quotes (") and a semicolon (;) like so:

Console.WriteLine("This will be printed to the console!");
